# ML-VOICE-BASED-DETECTION-OF-PARKINSONS-DISEASE
The project uses ML on voice data to detect Parkinson's Disease early, leveraging various algorithms to analyze vocal changes, aiming for a non-invasive, accurate diagnostic tool.
The "ML Voice-Based Detection of Parkinson's Disease" project employs machine learning (ML) to analyze voice data for early and accurate detection of Parkinson's Disease. This innovative approach leverages voice-based datasets, recognizing that vocal changes can be early indicators of neurological conditions. The project's strength lies in its use of a variety of ML models to sift through voice recordings, aiming to identify those subtle vocal signatures that might indicate the presence of Parkinson's Disease.

Key activities included preprocessing voice data to ensure clarity and consistency, extracting meaningful features that could serve as markers for the disease, and rigorously comparing different ML algorithms to find the most effective ones for this application. The project's goal was to develop a non-invasive, efficient, and accurate diagnostic tool that could potentially revolutionize early detection methods for Parkinson's Disease.

By focusing on non-invasive techniques, the project not only offers a glimpse into the future of medical diagnostics but also emphasizes patient comfort and accessibility. Early detection is crucial for managing Parkinson's Disease, and by providing a tool that can identify the disease before traditional symptoms become apparent, this project could significantly impact patients' treatment and management strategies.

In essence, the "ML Voice-Based Detection of Parkinson's Disease" project showcases the potential of machine learning in healthcare, specifically in developing innovative diagnostic tools. It stands as a testament to the power of combining technology and medical science to improve early detection and outcomes for individuals with Parkinson's Disease.
